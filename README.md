# Hello!

This is a pattern to do auth in svelte, react and next using axios

# How to use:

To install just clone the repo and then run npm install inside the folder.

Remember you will need to have the node or other js engine in your PC before

Then just do npm run dev, and if all is correct probably your code will work as intended!
